# UI/UX Rules

## Core Principles

### Mobile-First Design
- All layouts and components must be designed for mobile devices first (320px width minimum).
- Use responsive breakpoints: 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop).
- Ensure touch-friendly elements (minimum 44px tap targets).

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
- Use semantic HTML5 elements.
- Provide alt text for images.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Use ARIA labels where necessary.
- Test with screen readers.

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets.
- Minimize CSS/JS bundle sizes.
- Use system fonts for faster loading.
- Avoid heavy frameworks unless necessary.
- Aim for <3s load times on mobile.

### User Experience
- Keep navigation simple and intuitive.
- Use consistent spacing and typography.
- Provide clear visual hierarchy.
- Include loading states and feedback for interactions.
- Ensure content is scannable with headings and lists.
